# Validation

Target: DeepSeek Harness `0.1.0-rc.8` · validated 2026-08-20.

## Test architecture

| Layer | Command | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic quality gate | `pnpm verify` | ESLint, TypeScript, pinned asset hashes/catalogs, DSH boundary audit, unit/component tests, Host/Browser build |
| Cross-platform gate | `pnpm verify:portable` | Type, asset, unit and build behavior on macOS and Windows |
| Packaged DSH integration | `pnpm test:dsh` | Build, npm tarball, profile installation, official DSH Web startup, Session APIs, skill catalog, workspace routes and Chrome UI |
| Real provider | `pnpm test:dsh:real` | Official DeepSeek model, durable Agent completion, Oh Story Role calls, fiction review, short-drama review, read-only project digest and credential redaction |
| Release candidate | `pnpm verify:release` | Deterministic gate plus packaged DSH integration before tarball creation |

The paid real-provider layer is intentionally excluded from Pull Request CI. It is available as a manual GitHub Actions workflow and requires the repository Secret `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.

## Automated coverage

| Area | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Capability catalog | Native DSH Session exposes 13 Oh Story Skills and 10 Drama Skills |
| Upstream integrity | Both knowledge manifests verify pinned commits, catalogs and every bundled file hash |
| Plugin boundary | Host bundle and source audit keep all DSH imports inside `@oh-story/dsh` |
| Workspace safety | Tests cover canonical paths, missing write targets, traversal, absolute paths and symbolic-link escape |
| File following | Tests cover partial tool JSON, streamed write/edit projection, creative path classification and workbench switching |
| Markdown rendering | Component tests cover tables, task lists, fenced code, inline formatting, safe links and inert raw HTML |
| JSONL rendering | Component tests cover typed record summaries, source line numbers, scalar records and per-line parse failures |
| Three-column layout | Native DSH Chrome smoke checks ordered tree/editor/Chat geometry and minimum usable widths |
| Composer stability | Scroll regression confirms the official Composer remains fixed inside the Chat column |
| Dual workbench | Native smoke switches 小说/短剧 and opens Markdown and JSONL preview/source modes |
| Roles and hooks | Tests cover Role catalog, DSH child-Agent invocation and novel mutation guards |
| Package contents | Build and pack include both pinned knowledge sets, package metadata and license while omitting source tests and the standalone Drama Dashboard |

Current deterministic result: 8 test files and 25 tests passing.

## Native DSH Web audit

`pnpm test:dsh` creates an isolated DSH installation and profile, packs `@oh-story/dsh`, installs the tarball through `dsh plugin --profile web add`, and starts the official Web UI. The Chrome pass verifies:

- 13 Oh Story Skills and 10 Drama Skills in the Session catalog;
- Session-scoped workspace reads and path-traversal rejection;
- published Browser module and official UI slot registrations;
- 小说/短剧 navigation, Markdown table/task rendering and JSONL structured rendering;
- source editing, saved-state behavior and no duplicate Agent activity UI;
- ordered tree/editor/Chat geometry and a Composer that remains fixed during long-message scrolling.

The same audited surface generates the novel demo through `pnpm demo:story`; the command captures four current DSH states and replaces `docs/images/oh-story-dsh-demo.gif` deterministically.

## Real DeepSeek observation

The release test used `deepseek-official/deepseek-v4-flash` against the packed plugin:

- `story-review` completed with 4 `oh_story_role` calls and 20,003 durable Session events;
- `short-drama-review` completed with 7,816 durable Session events;
- both sessions produced durable assistant output;
- the combined fiction/short-drama project digest remained unchanged;
- the API credential did not appear in captured DSH logs.

Event totals are observations, not fixed assertions.

## CI workflows

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: Ubuntu quality gate, macOS/Windows portability, then packaged DSH Web integration.
- `.github/workflows/real-provider.yml`: manual paid real-provider test; cleanly skips when the Secret is absent.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: tag/manual release candidate gate and `.tgz` artifact upload; npm publication remains an explicit external action.

```bash
pnpm verify
pnpm test:dsh
